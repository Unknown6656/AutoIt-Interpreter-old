### There are only a few rules:
 
  1) The code must compile on all major platforms (Windows, Linux, MacOS, ...)
  2) The code must work **and** AutoIt3 must be compilable with your additions
  3) **DO NOT BREAK THE EXPRESSION PARSER** - This shit is costing me countless sleepless nights<br/>
     Feel free to contribute to it, **DO NOT BREAK IT** or I'll going to kill you!
  4) Document your features/bug fixes in the appropriate markdown document
  5) **USE ALLMAN FORMATTING AND INDENTATION STYLE**.<br/>
     Any contribution in some other style will not be accepted.
   
 ...and...
 
  6) Do not get brain cancer from the existing code base
